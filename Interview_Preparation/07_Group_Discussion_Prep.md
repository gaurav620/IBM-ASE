## Sample GD Topic Analysis

### Topic: "AI Replacing Human Jobs - Boon or Bane?"

**Points FOR AI:**

- Automates repetitive, mundane tasks
- Increases efficiency and productivity
- Creates new job categories (AI trainers, ethicists)
- Handles dangerous tasks (mining, nuclear)
- Available 24/7, no fatigue
- Example: IBM Watson in healthcare diagnosis

**Points AGAINST AI:**

- Mass unemployment in certain sectors
- Loss of human touch in services
- High implementation cost for SMEs
- Privacy and security concerns
- Skill gap - workers need retraining
- Example: Factory automation reducing labor

**Balanced Conclusion:**
> "AI is neither purely a boon nor a bane - it's a tool. The key lies in how we adapt. Rather than fearing job loss, we should focus on upskilling and creating policies for a smooth transition. History shows that every technological revolution created more jobs than it destroyed. The same can be true for AI if we prepare wisely."
