- Learned the importance of testing

**Result:** The professor appreciated my honesty. Now I always test my code thoroughly before submission.

### Q10: How do you handle learning something new?

**Answer:**
> I follow a structured approach:
>
> 1. **Understand the basics** through documentation and tutorials
> 2. **Practice immediately** with small examples
> 3. **Build something** to apply what I learned
> 4. **Teach/explain** to others (this helps reinforce my understanding)
