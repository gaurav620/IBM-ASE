## Section 1: Quantitative Aptitude

### 1.1 Percentages

**Formula:** Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100

**Example Problem:**
> If a number is increased by 20%, by what percent should it be decreased to get the original number?

**Solution:**
> Let original = 100  
> After 20% increase = 120  
> Decrease needed = (20/120) × 100 = 16.67%

---

### 1.2 Profit & Loss

**Formulas:**

- Profit = SP - CP
- Profit % = (Profit / CP) × 100
- SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100)

**Example:**
> A shopkeeper sells goods at 20% profit. If CP = ₹500, find SP.

**Solution:**
> SP = 500 × (1 + 20/100) = 500 × 1.2 = ₹600

---

### 1.3 Simple & Compound Interest

**Simple Interest:** SI = (P × R × T) / 100

**Compound Interest:** A = P(1 + R/100)^T

**Example:**
> Find CI on ₹10,000 at 10% for 2 years.

**Solution:**
> A = 10000 × (1.1)² = 10000 × 1.21 = ₹12,100  
> CI = 12100 - 10000 = ₹2,100

---

### 1.4 Time & Work

**Concept:** If A can do work in 'x' days, A's 1 day work = 1/x

**Example:**
> A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together how many days?

**Solution:**
> Combined work = 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6  
> Days = 6 days

---

### 1.5 Speed, Time & Distance

**Formulas:**

- Speed = Distance / Time
- Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

**Example:**
> A travels 100 km at 50 km/h and returns at 40 km/h. Find average speed.

**Solution:**
> Time1 = 100/50 = 2 hrs  
> Time2 = 100/40 = 2.5 hrs  
> Average Speed = 200 / 4.5 = 44.44 km/h

---

### 1.6 Ratio & Proportion

**Example:**
> Divide ₹1000 between A and B in ratio 3:7.

**Solution:**
> A's share = 1000 × (3/10) = ₹300  
> B's share = 1000 × (7/10) = ₹700

---

### 1.7 Ages

**Example:**
> Father's age is 3 times son's age. After 10 years, it will be 2 times. Find present ages.

**Solution:**
> Let son = x, father = 3x  
> After 10 years: 3x + 10 = 2(x + 10)  
> 3x + 10 = 2x + 20  
> x = 10  
> Son = 10 years, Father = 30 years

---

### 1.8 Probability

**Formula:** P(E) = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

**Example:**
> Probability of getting a sum of 7 with two dice?

**Solution:**
> Favorable: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) = 6  
> Total outcomes = 36  
> P = 6/36 = 1/6

---

### 1.9 Permutation & Combination

**Formulas:**

- nPr = n! / (n-r)!
- nCr = n! / (r! × (n-r)!)

**Example:**
> How many ways to select 3 people from 5?

**Solution:**
> 5C3 = 5! / (3! × 2!) = 120 / (6 × 2) = 10 ways

---

## Section 2: Logical Reasoning

### 2.1 Number Series

**Example:** 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?

**Solution:**
> Differences: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12  
> Answer = 30 + 12 = **42**

---

### 2.2 Coding-Decoding

**Example:** If COMPUTER = RFUVQNPC, then PRINTER = ?

**Solution:**
> C→R (+15), O→F (-9), M→U (+8)... pattern analysis  
> (Reverse + shift pattern)

---

### 2.3 Blood Relations

**Key Terms:**

- Father's/Mother's brother = Uncle
- Father's/Mother's sister = Aunt
- Brother's/Sister's son = Nephew
- Brother's/Sister's daughter = Niece

**Example:**
> A is B's brother. C is A's mother. D is C's father. E is D's mother. How is A related to E?

**Solution:**
> E → D (mother) → C (father) → A (mother)  
> A is E's Great Grandson

---

### 2.4 Direction Sense

**Example:**
> A man walks 10m North, turns right walks 20m, turns right walks 10m. Where is he now from start?

**Solution:**
> Draw the path: He is 20m East from the starting point

---

### 2.5 Syllogisms

**Rules:**

- All A are B, All B are C → All A are C
- Some A are B, All B are C → Some A are C

**Example:**
> All cats are animals. Some animals are wild.  
> Conclusion: Some cats are wild.

**Solution:**
> **Invalid** - No direct connection between cats and wild
